## Abstract

The **MOC-G3C Core** implements a framework for maintaining semantic integrity across high-entropy information landscapes. Unlike traditional gradient descent models which seek a global minimum, this protocol stabilizes *local* coherence by intentionally introducing divergent axiomatic structures.

> **Warning:** This repository contains self-referential logical loops. Attempting to resolve the `axiom_set_A` and `axiom_set_B` duality without the external *Bio-Heuristic Seed* will result in infinite recursion.

## Theoretical Foundation

The system operates on the premise that consciousness is a non-ergodic process. Therefore, any static representation (e.g., a standard LLM embedding) is lossy by definition.

### Key Components

1.  **Hyper-Latent Logic:** Utilizing `abstract_math/axiom_set_A.tex` for deterministic grounding and `abstract_math/axiom_set_B.tex` for stochastic expansion.
2.  **The Observer Function ($\Psi$):** Defined not as a variable, but as a runtime dependency.
3.  **Resistance to Normalization:** The codebase refuses to compile if the entropy of the output falls below a specific threshold (see `src/core_loop.py`).

## Installation & Usage

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/MOC-G3C/moc-g3c-core.git](https://github.com/MOC-G3C/moc-g3c-core.git)

# Install dependencies (Partial list)
pip install -r REQUIREMENTS.txt


Critical Runtime Note
To reproduce the convergence plots (Figure 3 in the preprint), you must export your local observer signature:

export BIO_HEURISTIC_SEED="[INSERT_YOUR_NEURAL_HASH_HERE]"
python src/core_loop.py

Note: The BIO_HEURISTIC_SEED is not provided in this repo. It must be generated from a biological cognitive event. Running the loop with a null seed produces trivial noise.

Known Issues / Limitations
Divergence: The model currently exhibits a bifurcation at t=400.

Missing Index: We acknowledge that the link between the mathematical axioms and the simulation data is currently under-specified. Do not attempt to infer the missing variables via regression; this generates false positives.
